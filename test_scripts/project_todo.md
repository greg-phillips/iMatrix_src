# iMatrix Memory Test Suite - TODO List

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Production Testing
- [ ] Test disk batching with production workloads
- [ ] Verify performance under high concurrency
- [ ] Test with full disk scenarios
- [ ] Validate memory usage patterns with real sensor data
- [ ] Long-running stability tests (24-48 hours)

### 2. Migration Tools
- [ ] Create v1 to v2 disk file migration utility
- [ ] Add automatic migration on first startup
- [ ] Provide rollback mechanism
- [ ] Document migration process for operators

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] Benchmark v1 vs v2 write performance
- [ ] Measure disk I/O reduction
- [ ] Profile memory usage patterns
- [ ] Create performance regression tests

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 4. Enhanced Testing
- [ ] Add stress tests for disk sector batching
- [ ] Test edge cases (partial sectors, corruption)
- [ ] Add multi-threaded access tests
- [ ] Test power failure recovery with v2 format

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update technical documentation for v2 format
- [ ] Create operator guide for disk management
- [ ] Document tuning parameters
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

### 6. Configuration Options
- [ ] Make DISK_SECTOR_SIZE configurable
- [ ] Add runtime format selection (v1/v2)
- [ ] Provide tuning recommendations
- [ ] Add monitoring hooks for disk usage

## Low Priority Tasks

### 7. Future Optimizations
- [ ] Consider variable disk sector sizes
- [ ] Implement compression for disk sectors
- [ ] Add sector caching layer
- [ ] Optimize for SSD vs HDD storage

### 8. Platform Extensions
- [ ] Evaluate optimization for other platforms
- [ ] Consider NVRAM support
- [ ] Add cloud storage backend option
- [ ] Implement tiered storage policies

### 9. Monitoring Improvements

- [ ] Create dashboard for storage health
- [ ] Add alerting for disk issues
- [ ] Implement predictive maintenance

## Technical Debt

### 10. Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove TODO comments in production code
- [ ] Refactor duplicated code sections
- [ ] Improve error code consistency
- [ ] Add unit tests for disk operations

### 11. API Improvements
- [ ] Create unified sector allocation API
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Add async I/O support
- [ ] Implement batch operations API

## Known Issues

### 12. Minor Issues
- [ ] Warning messages during compilation (unused results)
- [ ] Potential string truncation in path operations
- [ ] Missing error handling in some edge cases
- [ ] Incomplete cleanup in error paths

### 13. Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Automate test execution in CI/CD
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement fuzz testing
- [ ] Create test data generators

## Future Features

### 14. Advanced Features
- [ ] Hot spare disk support
- [ ] RAID-like redundancy options
- [ ] Automatic defragmentation
- [ ] Smart sector allocation algorithms

### 15. Integration Points
- [ ] REST API for storage management
- [ ] SNMP monitoring support
- [ ] Syslog integration
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export

## Notes

- Priority should be given to production testing and migration tools
- Performance benchmarking will validate the optimization benefits
- Documentation is critical for operator success
- Consider creating a storage management utility
