## Network Manager Improvements Project

### Goal
Review and fix critical issues in the network switching logic to reduce failover time from 30-60 seconds to 5-10 seconds, improve stability, and prevent race conditions.

### Initial Requirements
1. Review network switching and timing logic in process_network.c
2. Identify and fix flaws in the implementation
3. Implement WiFi reassociation enhancement from wifi_reassociation_todo.md
4. Add CLI display of WiFi reassociation settings
5. Complete implementation immediately (single day timeline)

### Identified Issues (10 Flaws)
1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads can modify interface states without synchronization
2. **Timer Logic Error**: Cooldown uses state_entry_time instead of current_time
3. **Missing Mutex Protection**: DNS cache accessed without synchronization
4. **No State Machine Validation**: Invalid state transitions not prevented
5. **Interface Ping-Ponging**: No hysteresis to prevent rapid switching
6. **Fixed Timing Constants**: No configuration for different environments
7. **WiFi Re-enable Timing**: No grace period for DHCP after re-enable
8. **Missing Interface Priority Documentation**: Logic for preferring eth0/wifi over cellular not clear
9. **Complex PPP Retry Logic**: Should be simplified with state machine
10. **No Fallback During Verification**: Missing handling when verify interface fails

- [x] Add mutex protection for all interface state changes
- [x] Fix cooldown timer to use current_time parameter

## Technical Architecture

### Synchronization Design
```c
// Per-interface mutex
pthread_mutex_t mutex;  // In iface_state_t

// Global state mutex
pthread_mutex_t state_mutex;  // In netmgr_ctx_t

// DNS cache mutex
static pthread_mutex_t dns_cache_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
```

### State Machine Validation
```c
// All transitions validated before execution
static bool is_valid_state_transition(ctx, from_state, to_state);
static bool transition_to_state(ctx, new_state);
```

### Hysteresis Configuration
```c
#define HYSTERESIS_WINDOW_MS     60000  // 1 minute
#define HYSTERESIS_SWITCH_LIMIT  3      // Max 3 switches
#define HYSTERESIS_COOLDOWN_MS   30000  // 30 second cooldown
#define HYSTERESIS_MIN_STABLE_MS 10000  // 10 second minimum
```

### Test Mode Commands
- `test force_fail <iface>` - Force interface failure
- `test clear_failures` - Clear all failures
- `test show_state` - Show detailed state
- `test dns_refresh` - Force DNS refresh
- `test hysteresis_reset` - Reset hysteresis
- `test set_score <iface> <n>` - Set interface score
