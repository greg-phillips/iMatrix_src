To prevent \"seeding\" the filter with a transient multipath point that happens to have a low HDOP, consider requiring 3 consecutive samples to be within $10\\text{m}$ of each other before setting the initial last_lat/last_lon.Hysteresis for Moving $\\to$ Stationary: The transition to STATIONARY requires 10 consecutive samples. However, ensure the transition from STATIONARY to MOVING is immediate (1 or 2 samples) to ensure trips aren't \"clipped\" at the start of a drive.",
