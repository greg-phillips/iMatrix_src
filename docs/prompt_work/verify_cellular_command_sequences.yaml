title: "The Fleet Connect 1 system uses a cellular modem to connect to the internet. verify the cellular command sequences."

task: |
on fist power up the cellular_man.c code should check if the device is already online.
If already connected then it should check the signal strength and if acceptable then it should check if the ppp0 interface is already up.
if ppp0 is not up then it should bring it up.
If the ppp0 fails the the cellular_man.c code should stop the ppp0 service, disconnect the cellular modem and scan for a new network.
The cellular_man.c code should then start the ppp0 service and connect to the new network.

This plan should document the steps taken, start / stop / restart the ppp0 service and the cellular modem commands issued.
Generate a detailed report based on the code for each scenario for me to review.

Ask any questions you need to before starting.
