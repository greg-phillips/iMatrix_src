title: "The memory manager is not spooling to disk when 80% level is reached."

task: |
  Determine why the memory manager is not spooling data to disk when 80% threshold is reached
  Read /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/docs/memory_manager_technical_reference.md
  Read using a sub agent is small sections this vey long log file: logs/mm1.log
  Determine why this is happening and fix it.
  After completion provide a summary of the changes made.
  Use the /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/docs/testing_fc_1_application.md to test the changes.

  Note the output from the ms command:
  '''

=== Disk Storage Statistics (MM2) ===
Disk Spooling:
  Status: Automatic (managed by MM2)
  Storage path: /tmp/mm2_spool/

Note: MM2 handles disk spooling automatically
      when memory pressure is detected.
