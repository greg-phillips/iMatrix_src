title: "We are integraging a new OBD2 gateway into the sytem and need to map the supported sensors into the system."

task: |
  The JSON file: /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/docs/FT220/list_of_sensors_returned.json 
  contains a list of the sensors supported by the FT2200 gateway.
  We need to map these sensors to the system.
  The system is using the iMatrix internal sensor definitions.
  The iMatrix internal sensor definitions are located in the file: /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/iMatrix/internal_sensors_def.h
  Review the JSON file along with the internal_sensors_def.h file to determine the mapping of the sensors.
  Create a document, docs/ft2200_mapping.md that describes the mapping of the sensors to the system. List any issues with data types and units.

Ask any questions you need to before starting the work.
