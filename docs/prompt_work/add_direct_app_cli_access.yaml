task: 
 The software has been deployed using the fc1 script. see: /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/docs/fc1_script_reference.md and /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/docs/ssh_access_to_Fleet_Connect.md
 Use SSH to connect to the host device and review the logs. see: /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/docs/connecting_to_Fleet-Connect-1.md
 The CLI has two modes. The default mode is the normal CLI mode. The other mode is the app CLI mode. 
 to switch between the the use can use the TAB key. or use the app command.
 Add new method to access the app cli directly without using the TAB key or the app command.
 Allow the entry of the prefix "app:" to access the app cli directly from the main CLI mode.
 Example:
 ```
 app: loopstatus
 ```
 will switch to the app CLI mode and display the loopstatus command.

The cli will stay in the main cli mode after the app command is entered.
