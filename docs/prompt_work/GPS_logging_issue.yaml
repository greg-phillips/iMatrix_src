title: "During testing the GPS logging is not working correctly"

task: 
  DUring testing we have found the logging of the GPS data is generating many invalid values.
  Review this file: U:\home\greg\iMatrix\iMatrix_Client\tools\142994297_2_3_20260102.json
  From my analysis I see the following:
  Data Quality & AnomaliesWhile most coordinates appear to center around 38.90° N, 119.96° W (near Lake Tahoe, Nevada/California border), there are several significant data integrity issues:1.
  Extreme Outliers & Measurement ErrorsThe statistics reveal physical impossibilities for coordinate data:Latitude Max (1974): Latitude cannot exceed 90°.
  This value is likely a transmission error or a different data type accidentally logged in this field.Latitude Min (-119.9626):
  This value is numerically identical to the standard Longitude for this set, suggesting a "flip" where longitude data was recorded in the latitude column.Longitude Max (38.9019):
  Similarly, this matches the standard Latitude for this set, indicating another column-flip error.2.
  Zero-Value ClustersThere are numerous instances where both Latitude and Longitude drop to 0.0 simultaneously (e.g., at 12:39:51Z on Jan 2nd).
  Impact: This usually indicates a loss of GPS fix or a sensor "warm-up" period where valid data was not yet acquired.
  3. Precision ShiftsTowards the end of the log (starting around 2026-01-03T15:12:53Z), the latitude values shift to extremely small scientific notations (e.g., $9.1835e-41$) while Longitude stays at exactly 0.
  This suggests a sensor failure or a software bug in the data export process.Key ObservationsPrimary Location: When the sensor is stable, the device is located at approximately 38.9018° N, 119.9625° W.
  Data Reliability: The data is highly unstable. Of the 7,329 points, a significant portion contains either zeros, column-swapped values, or impossible outliers (1974).
  
  Review the code in: /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/iMatrix/get_location.c
  and iMatrix/location/process_nmea.c
  
  and see if you can find the issue and fix it.
