task: |
  The Fleet-Connect-1 system uses arm toolchain to build the system. I need to duplicate the build system for the Fleet-Connect-1 project on another WSL instance.
  Review the build system documentation in the Fleet-Connect-1 project and duplicate the build system for the Fleet-Connect-1 project on another WSL instance.
  The build system documentation is in the Fleet-Connect-1/docs/BUILD_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md file.
  The ARM related documentation is in /home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/Fleet-Connect-1/ARM_CROSS_COMPILE_DETAILS.md.
  Copy all required ARM build tools to a /home/greg/qconnect_sw/ARM_Tools directory.
