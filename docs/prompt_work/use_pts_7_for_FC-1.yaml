  ## Objective
  Always use pts/7 for FC-1. 

  ## Requirements
  1. Read and understand the CLI and Debug system from the documentation
  2. Always use pts/7 for FC-1.
  3. After implementation allow me to review before proceeding with testing.

  ## Verification
  1. SSH into the FC-1 device (see ssh_access_to_Fleet_Connect.md)
  2. Run the FC-1 application
  3. Verify that pts/7 is available and always used for FC-1.
  4. use the microcom command to connect to the FC-1 application and verify that pts/7 is always used.

files_to_modify:
  - Fleet-Connect-1/init/imx_client_init.c

notes: |
  - Use the microcom command to connect to the FC-1 application and verify that pts/7 is always used. if pts/7 is not available, delete the pts/7 entry as this applicaton only has one instance of the FC-1 application running.
