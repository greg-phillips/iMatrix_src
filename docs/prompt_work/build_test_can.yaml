complexity_level: "simple"

title: "Build a new program to test the CAN bus"

task: 
  Using the main program in the source file test_system/can_test.c as a base, create a CMakeLists.txt file to build the program.
  The program needs to use the same build system that the Fleet-Connect-1 program uses.
  This program is cross compiled and used on a embedded target system.
  The libqfc and other libraries should be used from the Fleet-Connect-1 program.
  Ask any questions.
