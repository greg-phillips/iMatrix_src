# Validate OBD2 reponse processing code.

title: "Validate OBD2 reponse processing code."

task: |

The python OBD2 Library as been tested heavily and we want to use this as a reference for the OBD2 response processing code.
Read the entire python OBD2 Library documentation and understand the code. 
The repository has been cloned to the following path:
/home/greg/iMatrix/iMatrix_Client/python-OBD
read all the files in the python-OBD directory and understand the code.

Review the code in the Fleet-Connect-1/can_process directory and compare it to the python OBD2 Library.
Compare to ensure that our code is consistent with the python OBD2 Library.
Define any missing features or bugs in the iMatrix code.
