## Aim Add Feature
Add checks in the networking code when processing the udhcpd funcationlity 

Stop and ask questions if any failure to find Background material

## Code Structure:

iMatrix (Core Library): Contains all core telematics functionality (data logging, comms, peripherals).

Fleet-Connect-1 (Main Application): Contains the main system management logic and utilizes the iMatrix API to handle data uploading to servers.

## Backgroud

Read and understand the following

docs/comprehensive_code_review_report.md
docs/developer_onboarding_guide.md
docs/comprehensive_code_review_report.md


read all source files in iMatrix/IMX_Platform/networking/ special focus on udhcpd related functions

use the template files as a base for any new files created
iMatrix/templates/blank.c
iMatrix/templates/blank.h

Always create extensive comments using doxygen style

The system is built on a VM. Perform Linting on all generated code and then leave it to me to build and test.

The system creates configuratons files and runs the udhcpd server to allow clients to connect to the gateway

## Task
The current code automatically spawns new dhcpd servers without checking for instances already running. Existing instances must be killed before spwaning a new instance.

## Deliveralbles
1. Make a note of the current banches for iMatrix and Fleet-Connect-1 and create new git branchs for any work created.
2. Detailed plan document, *** docs/add_check_for_udhcpd_plan.md ***, of all aspectsa and detailed todo list for me to review before commencing the implementation.
3. Once plan is approved implement and check of the items on the todo list as they are completed.
4. Once I have determined the work is completed sucessfuly add a consise description to the plan document of the work undertaken and the number of tokens used, time taken in both eplased and actual work time  to complete the fearure.
5. merge the branch back in to the original branch.

## ASK ANY QUESIONS needed to verify work requirements.
