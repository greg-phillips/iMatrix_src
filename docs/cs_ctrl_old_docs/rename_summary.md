# Memory Manager File Rename Summary

## Rename Completed

### File Renamed
- **From**: `memory_manager_stubs.c`
- **To**: `memory_manager_utils.c`

### Reason for Rename
The file no longer contains stub implementations. All functions have been fully implemented with their original functionality from memory_manager-original.c. The new name better reflects the file's purpose as a collection of utility functions.

### Changes Made

1. **File rename**: 
   ```bash
   mv memory_manager_stubs.c memory_manager_utils.c
   ```

2. **Updated file header** (lines 26-32):
   - Changed `@file memory_manager_stubs.c` to `@file memory_manager_utils.c`
   - Updated description to reflect utility functions rather than stubs

3. **Updated section headers**:
   - "Disk Operations Stubs" → "Disk Operations"
   - "Recovery Journal Stubs" → "Recovery and Utility Functions"

4. **Updated CMakeLists.txt** (line 129):
   - Replaced `cs_ctrl/memory_manager_stubs.c` with `cs_ctrl/memory_manager_utils.c`

5. **Updated comments in memory_manager.c**:
   - Line 234: Updated reference from stubs to utils
   - Line 258: Updated reference from stubs to utils

## Functions in memory_manager_utils.c

The file now contains these fully implemented functions:

### Disk Operations
- `update_sector_location()` - Updates sector location in lookup table
- `get_sector_location()` - Returns current location of a sector
- `delete_disk_file_internal()` - Deletes disk files with error handling
- `ensure_directory_exists()` - Creates directories with proper permissions

### Recovery and Utility Functions
- `calculate_checksum()` - Calculates checksum for data integrity
- `process_incomplete_operations()` - Processes incomplete journal operations
- `rebuild_sector_metadata()` - Rebuilds sector metadata from disk files

## Note
Previous analysis documents still reference memory_manager_stubs.c but remain valid as historical documentation of the refactoring process.
