# Memory Manager Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Host Interface Functions (memory_manager.c)
Added three functions that were missing implementations:

```c
control_sensor_data_t *get_host_sd(void)      // Line 163 - Returns icb.csd
imx_control_sensor_block_t *get_host_sb(void) // Line 172 - Returns icb.csb  
uint16_t get_host_no_sensors(void)            // Line 181 - Returns icb.no_sensors
```

These functions provide access to the host control/sensor data structures through the iMatrix Control Block (icb).

### 2. Recovery Functions (memory_manager_stubs.c)

#### process_incomplete_operations() - Lines 162-224
- Replaced stub with full implementation from original file
- Changed return type from `imx_memory_error_t` to `int`
- Updated to use:
  - `tiered_module_state.journal_initialized` instead of `journal_initialized`
  - `delete_disk_file_internal()` instead of `delete_disk_file()`
  - Return 0 for success, -1 for error
- Added extern declarations for journal functions at top of file

#### rebuild_sector_metadata() - Lines 230-296
- Replaced stub with full implementation from original file
- Changed return type from `imx_memory_error_t` to `uint32_t`
- Updated to use:
  - `tiered_module_state.current_disk_file_count`
  - `tiered_module_state.next_disk_sector`
- Returns the number of disk files processed instead of error code

### 3. External Declarations Added
Added to memory_manager_stubs.c (lines 55-56):
```c
extern void journal_rollback_operation(uint32_t sequence);
extern void journal_complete_operation_internal(uint32_t sequence);
```

## Functions Review in memory_manager_stubs.c

Current status of all functions:
1. ✅ `update_sector_location()` - Fully implemented
2. ✅ `get_sector_location()` - Fully implemented  
3. ✅ `delete_disk_file_internal()` - Fully implemented
4. ✅ `ensure_directory_exists()` - Fully implemented
5. ✅ `calculate_checksum()` - Fully implemented (utility function)
6. ✅ `process_incomplete_operations()` - Now fully implemented
7. ✅ `rebuild_sector_metadata()` - Now fully implemented

## Dependencies

All implementations depend on:
- Global variables from memory_manager_internal.h:
  - `sector_lookup_table`
  - `journal`
  - `disk_files`
  - `tiered_module_state`
- System includes already present in the file

## Testing Notes

To verify the implementation:
1. Compile all memory manager modules
2. Link with the main application
3. Test scenarios:
   - Host interface functions should return valid pointers
   - Recovery operations should process journal entries correctly
   - Metadata rebuild should reconstruct sector lookup table from disk files

## Conclusion

All missing functions have been implemented. The memory manager refactoring is now complete with:
- 3 host interface functions implemented in memory_manager.c
- 2 recovery functions fully implemented in memory_manager_stubs.c
- All stub functions now have proper implementations

The memory_manager_stubs.c file could potentially be renamed to something more appropriate (like memory_manager_utils.c) since it no longer contains stubs.
