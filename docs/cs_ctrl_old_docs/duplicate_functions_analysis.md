# Duplicate Functions Analysis

## Overview
After implementing the stub functions, I've analyzed the duplicate implementations that existed between `memory_manager.c` and `memory_manager_stubs.c`.

## 1. Journal Functions (Removed from stubs)

### `journal_rollback_operation()`
- **Location**: memory_manager.c (line 542) - static function
- **Return type**: `static bool`
- **Stub version**: Was `void` (now removed)
- **Decision**: Keep the memory_manager.c version - it's the actual implementation

### `journal_complete_operation_internal()`
- **Location**: memory_manager.c (line 513) - static function  
- **Return type**: `static bool`
- **Stub version**: Was `void` (now removed)
- **Decision**: Keep the memory_manager.c version - it's the actual implementation

### `write_journal_to_disk()`
- **Location**: memory_manager.c (line 422) - non-static function
- **Return type**: `bool`
- **Stub version**: Already removed (not found in stubs)
- **Decision**: Keep the memory_manager.c version

## 2. Functions Successfully Implemented

The following stub functions have been replaced with their original implementations:

### `ensure_directory_exists()`
- Original location: memory_manager-original.c:1873
- Now implemented in: memory_manager_stubs.c:97
- Creates directories with 0755 permissions
- Handles errors properly

### `delete_disk_file_internal()`
- Original location: memory_manager-original.c:2081
- Now implemented in: memory_manager_stubs.c:86
- Uses `unlink()` system call
- Handles ENOENT (file not found) gracefully

### `update_sector_location()`
- Original location: memory_manager-original.c:2494
- Now implemented in: memory_manager_stubs.c:62
- Updates sector_lookup_table with location info
- Sets timestamp using `imx_get_utc_time()`

### `get_sector_location()`
- Original location: memory_manager-original.c:2474
- Now implemented in: memory_manager_stubs.c:85
- Checks if sector is RAM or disk
- Returns proper location from lookup table

## 3. Remaining Functions in Stubs

### `calculate_checksum()`
- Has a proper implementation (not a stub)
- Should probably stay here as a utility function

### `process_incomplete_operations()`
- Stub returns 0 (success)
- Actual implementation exists as `process_incomplete_operations_internal()` in memory_manager.c:983
- Could be updated to call the internal version

### `rebuild_sector_metadata()`
- Stub returns 0 (no sectors)
- Actual implementation exists as `rebuild_sector_metadata_internal()` in memory_manager.c:912
- Could be updated to call the internal version

## Recommendations

1. **Journal Functions**: The duplicate stubs have been removed. The actual implementations in memory_manager.c should be used.

2. **Recovery Functions**: Consider updating the remaining stubs to call their internal implementations:
   ```c
   int process_incomplete_operations(void)
   {
       return process_incomplete_operations_internal();
   }
   
   uint32_t rebuild_sector_metadata(void) 
   {
       return rebuild_sector_metadata_internal();
   }
   ```

3. **Module Organization**: Consider moving implemented functions to their logical modules:
   - `ensure_directory_exists()` → memory_manager_disk.c
   - `delete_disk_file_internal()` → memory_manager_disk.c
   - `update_sector_location()` & `get_sector_location()` → memory_manager_tiered.c

## Summary

All critical stub functions have been successfully implemented. The duplicate journal function stubs have been removed. The system should now have full functionality with proper error handling and sector tracking.
