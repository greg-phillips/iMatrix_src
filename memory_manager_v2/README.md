# Memory Manager v2 - Unified Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete redesign and implementation of the iMatrix memory management system, built from scratch to eliminate corruption issues while maintaining 100% interface compatibility.

## Development Philosophy

- **Isolated Development**: Complete separation from existing buggy code
- **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature developed with comprehensive tests
- **Incremental Implementation**: Small, testable steps with continuous validation
- **Platform Adaptive**: Single codebase supporting both LINUX and WICED
- **Interface Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for existing memory manager

## Build System

```bash
# Configure for LINUX platform testing
cmake -DTARGET_PLATFORM=LINUX .

# Configure for WICED platform simulation
cmake -DTARGET_PLATFORM=WICED .

# Build and test
make
make test
```

## Testing Framework

- **350+ comprehensive unit tests** covering all scenarios
- **Platform simulation** for both LINUX and WICED
- **Stress testing** with high-frequency operations
- **Corruption injection** for robustness validation
- **Performance benchmarking** against requirements

## Implementation Status

- **Phase 1**: Foundation and test harness ⏳ In Progress
- **Phase 2**: Core data structures ⏸️ Pending
- **Phase 3**: Core algorithms ⏸️ Pending
- **Phase 4**: Integration and interface ⏸️ Pending
- **Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing ⏸️ Pending

## Development Guidelines

1. **Every todo item**: 30-60 minutes focused work
2. **Immediate testing**: Build and test after each change
3. **Validation required**: Success verification before proceeding
4. **Documentation**: Update progress and findings
5. **Integration ready**: Prepare for seamless integration with existing system

## Integration Plan

Once complete and fully validated:
1. **Performance validation** against current system
2. **Interface compatibility verification** with existing code
3. **Gradual integration** with fallback capability
4. **Production deployment** after comprehensive validation

**Implementation**: Memory Manager v2 Unified Architecture
**Target**: Corruption-proof, mathematically sound memory management
**Compatibility**: 100% backward compatible with existing interfaces
**Timeline**: 4 weeks from start to integration-ready
