title: "Fix memory leak in CAN processing"

task: |
  Fix the memory leak occurring in can_process.c when processing high-frequency
  CAN messages. The leak was identified at line 245 where allocated buffers are
  not being freed after processing.

  Steps:
  1. Review can_process.c line 245 and surrounding code
  2. Identify where buffer allocation occurs
  3. Add proper cleanup/free calls
  4. Verify with valgrind that leak is resolved
