    The Cellular system uses AT commands to control the cellular radio.
    The cellular code initializes, if already connected keeps carrier.
    If not then scans for best and selects that.
  - |
    The cellular code will set flags that the process_network monitors
    with helper functions. If the process_network cannot connect on the
    ppp0 link it will blacklist the carrier. The cellular system is then
    responsible for connection to the next non-blocklisted carrier.
